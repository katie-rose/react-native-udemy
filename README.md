Last Course Update: August 5, 2019! 

If you're tired of spinning your wheels learning Swift or Android, this is the course for you.

Authentication? You will learn it.  Hooks? Included.  Navigation? Of course!

This course will get you up and running with React Native quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components for mobile devices.

Both OSX and Windows supported - develop iOS or Android!

We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props", “state", and event handling. Source code is provided for each lecture, so you will always stay up-to-date with the course pacing.  Special attention has been paid to creating reusable components that you'll be able to make use of on your own fantastic projects.

React Native is an excellent solution for developing apps on mobile in a fraction of the time it takes to make an equivalent iOS or Swift app.  You'll love seeing your changes instantly appear on your own device, rather than waiting for Swift/Java code to recompile!  This quick feedback loop, along with excellent cross platform support, is what has catapulted React Native to the top must-have skill for Javascript engineers.

If you are new to React, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the React course for you! To learn React you have to understand it.
